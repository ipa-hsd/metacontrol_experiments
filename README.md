# metacontrol_experiments

This package runs and controls batch simulations of the [metacontrol_sim](https://github.com/rosin-project/metacontrol_sim) package, it can create contingencies that should result in reconfigurations of the navigation stack.

## Installation

### Install java jre

The experiments use the [`mros_reasoner`](https://github.com/tud-cor/mc_mros_reasoner) for the reconfiguration, and to run this a java jre is required.

You can use this command To install the Java Vitual Machine.

```console
sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jre
```

### Create metacontrol_ws

- We recommend you to create a workspace only for `metacontrol_ws`, for example:

```console
  mkdir -p ~/metacontrol_ws/src
  cd metacontrol_ws
```

### Setup all dependencies using wstool

**Note** This step will include all the necessary packages, including those listed in the [metacontrol_sim](https://github.com/rosin-project/metacontrol_sim) package. Please make sure you're not duplicating them.

In the following instructions, we assume that the ROS workspace is called `metacontrol_ws`, but you can give it any name you want.

```console
cd ~/metacontrol_ws
wstool init src https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rosin-project/metacontrol_experiments/master/metacontrol_experiments.rosinstall
rosdep install --from-paths ./src -y -i -r --skip-keys="abb_rws_interface"
```

Check that all dependencies are installed correctly, please make an issue if you find any errors.

## Build the code

The code can be built using the standard `catkin build` process.

```console
cd ~/metacontrol_ws
source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash
catkin build
```

## Run the scripts

There are several scripts, to run a single simulation or to run simulations on a batch.

- `run_single_sim.sh` : Main script, runs a full simulation on a single terminal, the parameter are listed below.
- `run_single_sim_desktop.sh` : Runs a full simulation, but launches three different terminals. Accepts the same parameters as `run_single_sim.sh` Runs a single simulation on a single terminal. **Note:** gnome-terminal needs to be installed for this script to run.
- `run_batch_sim.sh` and  `run_combined_test.sh`: Both are used to run a batch of simulations, they use the `run_single_sim` script whit different configurations at every time.

### Parameters for a single simulation run

The `run_single_sim.sh` and  `run_single_sim_desktop.sh` scripts accept the following parameters:

```bash
-i <init_position: (1 / 2 / 3)>
-g <goal_position: (1 / 2 / 3)>
-n <nav_profile: ("fast" / "standard" / "safe" or fX_vX_rX)>
-r <run mros reconfiguration: ("true" / "false")>
-o <add obstacles: (0 / 1 / 2 / 3)>
-p <increase_power: ([0 -  2.0])>
-b <record rosbags: ("true" / "false")>
-e <nfr energy threshold : ([0 - 1])>
-s <nfr safety threshold : ([0 - 1])>
-l <.csv log frequency : [0 - 10])  - 0 Means no .csv logs will be recorded>
-c <close reasoner terminal after execution : ("true" / "false")>
-v <Run RVIZ : ("false" / "true" )>
```

If no parameters are given the first value is used by default

### Example of single run

This launch should result in one or two reconfigurations

```console
source ~/metacontrol_ws/devel/setup.bash
roscd metacontrol_experiments
./run_single_sim_desktop.sh -i 1 -g 1 -n "f1_v2_r2" -o 2 -r "true" -p 1.7 -c "false"
```

#### Expected outcome

The script opens three additional terminals and one rviz window

  1. roscore
  1. Gazebo simulation with MVP metacontrol world.launch
  1. mros reasoner

The output of the main console (where the script is executed) should be like this

```console
$ ./run_single_sim.sh -i 1 -g 1 -n "f1_v2_r2" -o 2 -r "true" -p 1.7 -c "false"
Make sure there is no other gazebo instances or ROS nodes running:
kill -2 6644
kill -2 6884
kill -2 7017

##### Notes

- At the beggining of the script, all previous gazebo and ROS nodes are killed, if there is a gazebo process running or lagging, this may take some time and a message `-- gzserver still running` may appear.

- The `===REQUIRED process [stop_simulation_node-1] has died!` part, appears red, but it's not an error, is due to the process being terminated at the end of the simulation.

- RViz and the three terminals should close at the end of the simulation. However, if the `-c "false"` option is given, the `mros_reasoner` terminal will wait for an external input before closing.

### Run simulations in batch

Edit the for loops inside `./run_batch_sim.sh` to define set of parameters and whether or not to run reconfiguration

Run the script

```console
./run_batch_sim.sh
```

## Getting logs

Two type of logs are available

### csv files

The `stop_simulation_node` subscribes to the topics containing the relevant info for the logs, it extracts the corresponding info (i.e. corresponding `key` value from the `diagnostics` topic for the QA) and stores them in a `.csv` at a given frequency as

- The default storage folder is `"$(find metacontrol_experiments)/data/"`
- The storage folder can be modified in the `launch/stop_simulation.launch` file
- Store frequency can be modified in the `launch/stop_simulation.launch` file ( 0 means no recording)

### rosbags

- `.bag` files can be stored if the parameter -b true is given to the `run_single_sim.sh` scripts
- The default storage folder is `"$(find metacontrol_experiments)/bags/"`
- The storage folder can be modified in the `launch/stop_simulation.launch` file
